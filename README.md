<h3>Task Guideline</h3>

<p>
There's few better ways to assess someone's programming skills than to have them undertake a reasonably open ended coding task. This task is borrowed heavily from westpac mobile coding test, so thank you to those people for such a great boilerplate.
</p>

<h3>Requirements </h3>

<p>
The task is to use Laravel Framework to create a basic web application that displays the current temperature using https://forecast.io/ , using the geolocation of your browser. 
</p>

<h3>Key business requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Display the current temperature in degrees Celsius</li>
  <li>Display the temperature based on the geolocation of your browser</li>
  <li>Display a simple icon and label based on the weather information provided (eg. Sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.)</li>
  <li>The API request must be proxied via your web application, ie. Do not make a request from the client side directly to https://developer.forecast.io/ for the weather information. It must go via your localhost app. </li>
</ul>
   
<h3>What we will be looking for in the application </h3>
<p>
We are looking for engineers that can lead technology and design decisions without the need for explicit guidance. This is why we are not providing an exact outline of what we are looking for, so we influence your direction on this task as little as possible. We want to see how you work unencumbered and get to know what really matters to you when developing a web application. 
</p>

<h3>Getting Started </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fork this repository</li>
  <li>Register for a free API key at: https://developer.forecast.io/</li>
  <li>Commit your code, and send us a pull request when you are finished.</li>
</ul>
